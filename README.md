See https://www.xignite.com/MyAccount/#/api/trials for more details.

2- Create an free account on streamdata.io https://portal.streamdata.io/#/register to get an App token.

3- Edit index.html and replace [YOUR_XIGNITE_TOKEN] and [YOUR_STREAMDATAIO_APP_TOKEN] with the corresponding keys.

4- Launch the app with your favorite server
  * the simplest way, if Python is installed on your machine, is to run the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` 
  * if you are an npm afficionados, you can use http-server
  
  ```
  npm install http-server
  node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server .
  ```  

5- Open your favorite browser (works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 10+) at `http://localhost:8080`
